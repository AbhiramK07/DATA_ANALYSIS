# Healthcare Insights Dashboard

An interactive Excel dashboard designed to analyze patient demographics, medical conditions, healthcare costs, insurance types, and admission trends.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on creating a comprehensive Excel dashboard to uncover actionable insights from healthcare data. It enables users to explore patterns in patient age groups, gender distribution, medical conditions, insurance coverage, and types of hospital admissions through dynamic visualizations.

## Tools & Features Used

- **Microsoft Excel**
  - Pivot Tables
  - Pivot Charts (Bar, Pie, Column)
  - Slicers
  - Conditional Formatting
  - Dynamic Ranges
  - Data Filters

## Key Dashboard Components

1. **Patient Demographics**
   - Gender-wise patient count using pie chart
   - Age group analysis with conditional formatting and pie chart (Children, Adults, Seniors)

2. **Medical Conditions**
   - Horizontal bar chart showing patient count per condition (e.g., Diabetes, Asthma)

3. **Test Result Overview**
   - Slicer to filter results by test outcome (Positive, Negative, Inconclusive)

4. **Insurance & Admission Type**
   - Stacked column chart to display admission types (Elective, Emergency, Urgent) by insurance provider

5. **Cost Analysis**
   - Pie chart visualizing total healthcare costs by age category

6. **Blood Type Distribution**
   - Slicer for blood type filters

## Insights Generated

- Majority of patients fall into the **Adult** category, contributing to the highest treatment costs.
- **Female** patients slightly outnumber male patients.
- **Diabetes and Arthritis** are the most common medical conditions in the dataset.
- **Emergency admissions** are most frequent, particularly among a few key insurance providers.
- Visual filters allow instant toggling between test results, blood types, and other demographic fields.
